# PHYSICS

my previous work using the techiniques of Verlet Integration in my 2d physics engine, and simply ports the same technique using the extra axis. This was pretty simple to do, due to most of the difficult physics techniques already being done, but was a good project to do to test and further advance my OpenGL knowledge.
